## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm JIANG Zhuoyang
- ðŸ”­ I am currently an intern at Microsoft Research AI for Science.
- ðŸŒ² I am currently a student in the MSc DCAI program at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Guangzhou (HKUST gz). 
- ðŸŒ± I earned my BEng in AI from Southeast University, Nanjing (SEU).
- ðŸ¤” My research interests target the intelligent upgrading of **Architecture** and **Urban Planning** disciplines by researching on <font color=CadetBlue>**Data-centric**</font>, <font color=DarkSalmon>**AI-driven**</font> and <font color=DarkGreen>**Human-oriented**</font> Foundation Models in the fields of AI4Science, urban/social computing, and human-computer interaction.

## My Vision for Future Research:
In life's journey, I want to **explore the possibilities of technological innovation in Analysis and Design for Architecture and Urban** from three perspectives:
- **Data (Construction of Architecture and Urban Big Data):**
  - Representation Learning:
    - Graphs Data
    - Spatial and Temporal Data
    - Multimodal Data
  - Dataset & Annotation & Benchmark
- **Models (Development of Foundational AI Systems for Urban and Architecture):**
  - Foundation Models:
    - Pre-training Tasks
    - Urban & Social Computing Tasks
    - Graph & 2D & 3D Generation Tasks
- **Users (Development of AI-assisted Design Tools for Architects and Urban planners):**
  - Human-AI Interaction:
    - Creative Aids
    - Efficiency Aids
