## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm JIANG Zhuoyang
- ðŸ”­ I am currently an intern at MSR AI4Science.
- ðŸŒ± I am currently a student in the MSc DCAI program at HKUST(GZ). Before that, I was a BEng in the School of AI at Southeast University (SEU).
- ðŸ¤” My research interests target the intelligent upgrading of architecture and urban planning disciplines by researching on data-centric, AI-driven and human-oriented Foundation Models in the fields of AI4Science, urban computing, and human-computer interaction.

## My Research Pathway Now in 2025:

## My vision for future research:
In life's journey, I want to explore the possibilities of technological innovation in design for architecture and cities from three perspectives:
- **Data (Construction of Architecture and Urban Big Data):**
  - Representation Learning:
    - Graphs
    - Spatial and Temporal Data
    - Multimodal
  - Dataset & Annotation & Benchmark
- **Models (Development of Foundational AI Systems for Urban and Architecture):**
  - Foundation Models:
    - Pre-training
    - 2D & 3D Generation
  - Urban & Social Computing
- **Users (Development of AI-assisted Design Tools for Architects and Urban planners):**
  - Human-AI Interaction:
    - Creative Aids
    - Efficiency Aids
