## Hi there 👋 I'm JIANG Zhuoyang
- 🔭 I am currently an Research Assitant at **CityMind Lab, HKUST(GZ)** (Nov. 2025 - Present).
- 🪵 I served as a Research Intern at **Microsoft Research AI for Science** (Aug. 2024 - Jul. 2025) and the **Zhongguancun Academy** (Aug. 2025 - Nov. 2025).
- 🌲 I earned my MSc in DCAI from **HKUST(GZ)** (Sep. 2023 - Jul. 2025). 
- 🌱 I earned my BEng in AI from **Southeast University** (Sep. 2019 - Jun. 2023).
- 🤔 My research interests target the intelligent upgrading of **Architecture** and **Urban Planning** disciplines by researching on <font color=CadetBlue>**Data-centric**</font>, <font color=DarkSalmon>**AI-driven**</font> and <font color=DarkGreen>**Human-oriented**</font> Foundation Models in the fields of AI4Science, urban/social computing, and human-computer interaction.

## My Vision for Future Research:
In life's journey, I want to **explore the possibilities of technological innovation in Analysis and Design for Architecture and Urban** from three perspectives:
- **Data (Construction of Architecture and Urban Big Data):**
  - Dataset & Annotation & Benchmark
  - Representation Learning:
    - Graphs Data
    - Spatial and Temporal Data
    - Multimodal Data
- **Models (Development of Foundational AI Systems for Urban and Architecture):**
  - Foundation Models:
    - Pre-training
    - Downstream Tasks of Prediction: Urban & Social Computing 
    - Downstream Tasks of Generation: Multi-scale Habitats Design 
- **Users (Development of AI-assisted Design Tools for Architects and Urban planners):**
  - Human-AI Interaction and Multi-agent System:
    - Creative Aids
    - Efficiency Aids
