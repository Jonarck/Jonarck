## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm JIANG Zhuoyang
- ðŸ”­ I am currently an intern at MSR AI4Science.
- ðŸŒ± I am currently a student in the MSc DCAI program at HKUST(GZ). Before that, I was a BEng in the School of AI at Southeast University (SEU).
- ðŸ¤” My research interests target the intelligent upgrading of architecture and urban planning disciplines by researching on data-centric, AI-driven and human-oriented Foundation Models in the fields of AI4Science, urban computing, and human-computer interaction.

## My Vision for Future Research:
In life's journey, I want to explore the possibilities of technological innovation in design for architecture and cities from three perspectives:
- **Data (Construction of Architecture and Urban Big Data):**
  - Representation Learning:
    - Graphs Data
    - Spatial and Temporal Data
    - Multimodal Data
  - Dataset & Annotation & Benchmark
- **Models (Development of Foundational AI Systems for Urban and Architecture):**
  - Foundation Models:
    - Pre-training Tasks
    - 2D & 3D Generation Tasks
    - Urban & Social Computing Tasks
- **Users (Development of AI-assisted Design Tools for Architects and Urban planners):**
  - Human-AI Interaction:
    - Creative Aids
    - Efficiency Aids
