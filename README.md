## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm JIANG Zhuoyang
- ðŸ”­ I am currently an intern at MSR AI4Science.
- ðŸŒ± I am currently a student in the MSc DCAI program at HKUST(GZ). Before that, I was a BEng in the School of AI at Southeast University (SEU).
- ðŸ¤” My research interests target the intelligent upgrading of architecture and urban planning disciplines by researching on data-centric, AI-driven and human-oriented Foundation Models in the fields of AI4Science, urban computing, and human-computer interaction.



Explore the possibilities of technological innovation in design for architecture and cities from three perspectives:

- Data (Building Building Big Data): [Representation Learning] - {Graphs} - {Spatial and Temporal Data} - {Multimodal} / [Dataset & Benchmark].
- Models (developing architectural AGI systems): [Cornerstone Models] - {Pre-training} - {2D & 3D Generation} - {Urban & Social Computing}
- Users (Development of AI-assisted architectural design tools): [Human Intelligence Interaction] - {Creative Aids} - {Efficiency Aids}
